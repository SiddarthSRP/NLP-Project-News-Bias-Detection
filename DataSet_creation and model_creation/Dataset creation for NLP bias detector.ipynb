While  162  trains  are  in  transit , 1 ,252  trains  have  reached  their  destinations . Around  116  trains  are  currently  in  the  pipeline , it  said . Since  May  1 , the  railways  has  ferried  around  18 .5  lakh  migrants  home . According  to  available  data , 496  trains  have  originated  from  Gujarat  and  17  more  are  in  the  pipeline , while  266  trains  have  already  started  from  Maharashtra , with  37  more  in  the  pipeline . Among  the  other  originating  states , 188  trains  have  started  from  Punjab , 89  from  Karnataka , 61  from  Tamil  Nadu , 58  from  Telangana , 54  from  Rajasthan , 41  from  Haryana  and  38  from  Uttar  Pradesh  . Out  of  the  trains , which  have  terminated  so  far , the  maximum  has  been  in  Uttar  Pradesh  (641 ) while  73  more  are  in  transit , followed  by  Bihar  (310 ) with  53  more  on  its  way  to  the  state . Live  Events  The  operation  of  these  trains  has , however , led  to  a  political  mudslinging  with  first  the  opposition  accusing  the  Centre  of  charging  fare  from  migrants  and  then  the  Centre  accusing  some  states  with  the  non -BJP  government  not  allowing  providing  permission  for  migrant  trains  to  run . Railway  Minister  Piyush  Goyal  , in  a  series  of  tweets , on  Monday  said  he  had  spoken  to  the  Odisha , Bihar  and  Uttar  Pradesh  governments  and  they  have  all  assured  him  that  they  will  permit  more  trains  to  their  respective  states . In  the  case  of  Odisha , migrant  special  trains  would  have  to  be  suspended  due  to  cyclone  'Amphan ', he  said , adding  that  after  it  passes , trains  will  be  allowed . Goyal  also  tweeted  that  he  had  a  discussion  with  Bihar  Chief  Minister  Nitish  Kumar  about  the  migrant  special  trains  and  he  was  given  the  assurance  that  the  state  will  give  permission  to  run  50  'Shramik  Special ' trains  per  day . \\\"Chief  Minister  of  Uttar  Pradesh  @mYogiityanath . There  was  a  discussion  with  Nitish  Kumar  ji  about  migrant  labourers  and  I  am  glad  that  he  approved  to  double  the  number  of  Shramik  Special  trains  for  the  state ,\\\" he  said . The  Centre  has  also  said  it  has  the  capacity  to  run  300  'Shramik  Special ' trains  per  day  with  Goyal  appealing  to  states  like  West  Bengal  , Rajasthan , Chhattisgarh  and  Jharkhand  to  approve  more  trains . \\\"We  are  fully  ready  for  large  scale  operation  of  Shramik  spl  (special ) trains . So  far  1414  trains  (have  operated ) and  more  than  18 .5  lakh  people  (have  been  ferried ),\\\" a  railway  spokesperson  said . A  'Shramik  Special ' train  carries  around  1 ,700  passengers , instead  of  the  earlier  1 ,200 , to  ferry  as  many  workers  home  as  possible . Initially , these  trains  had  no  scheduled  stoppages  during  the  journey , but  the  railways  now  allows  up  to  three  stoppages  in  the  destination  states . While  the  transporter  is  yet  to  announce  the  cost  incurred  on  these  special  services , officials  indicated  that  the  national  transporter  is  spending  around  Rs  80  lakh  per  service . ( )\",\n          \"KOLHAPUR : The  Congress  victory  in  the  Kolhapur  North  assembly  byelection  has  given  the  city  its  first  elected  woman  representative  in  the  state  assembly  in  the  form  of  Jayashri  Jadhav . The  Congress  successfully  retained  the  seat , the  result  for  which  was  declared  on  Saturday . The  winning  margin  was  4 ,000  votes  more  than  the  votes  in  the  previous  assembly  election  in  2019 . Congress  candidate  Jayashri  Jadhav , the  widow  of  late  MLA  Chandrakant  Jadhav , secured  97 ,332  votes , while  her  closest  contender  BJPs  Satyajeet  Kadam  secured  78 ,025 . Jadhav  won  by  a  margin  of  19 ,307  votes  as  against  the  15 ,199  winning  margin  secured  by  her  husband  Chandrakant  Jadhav  in  the  2019  assembly  election . In  2019 , Shiv  Sena  and  BJP  contested  together  while  Congress  and  NCP  had  an  alliance . The  round -wise  counting  shows  that  Kadam  had  secured  more  votes  only  in  six  of  the  26  rounds . In  all  six  rounds , Kadam  was  ahead  of  Jadhav  by  2 ,740  votes . An  analysis  of  the  result  shows  that  7 ,501  votes , which  is  38 % of  the  winning  margin  of  19 ,307  secured  by  Jadhav , came  from  the  Kasba  Bawda  area , which  is  a  stronghold  of  Congress  leader  and  guardian  minister  Satej  Patil . Kadam  made  some  dent  in  the  Kasba  Bawda  vote  bank . However , Kadam  surprisingly  had  fewer  votes  in  his  favour  in  the  areas  where  he  has  a  following  such  as  Kadamwadi , Jadhavwadi  and  Ruikar  Colony . Kadam  was  the  corporator  from  the  Kadamwadi  area . However , in  the  entire  Kadamwadi  area , with  23 ,769  votes , Kadam  secured  a  margin  of  mere  653  votes  against  Jadhav  . The  wafer  thin  margin  in  Kadamwadi  may  have  prompted  the  BJP  to  introspect . BJP  had  levelled  allegations  that  Satej  Patil  put  pressure  on  Kasba  Bawda  residents  to  vote  for  Congress . Same  allegations  were  levelled  by  Congress  and  NCP  leaders  that  Kadam  and  Mahadiks  put  a  lot  of  pressure  on  Kadamwadi  residents  and  they  should  vote  against  BJP  to  show  them  their  place . The  large  dent  made  in  Kadamwadi  by  Congress  shows  that  residents  seem  to  have  followed  the  Congress  advice . The  low  voter  turnout  in  the  areas  of  BJP  dominance  seems  to  have  caused  Kadam  a  setback . Places  such  as  Shivaji  Park , Nagala  Park , Ruikar  Colony  gave  him  slight  margin , but  it  proved  inadequate  to  overcome  the  margin  secured  by  Jadhav  in  other  places .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1763,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2020-03-14\",\n          \"2022-03-24\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Extracted Keywords\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8826,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"city kanpur etawah safari lion who sired many cubs dies\",\n          \"markets stocks earnings infosys announce results oct\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Main Category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 9,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Culture and Lifestyle\",\n          \"Sports\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Sub-category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 44,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Nutrition\",\n          \"Pandemics\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":34}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Combine Title and Content\n","df['Article_Text'] = df['Title'] + ' ' + df['Content']"],"metadata":{"id":"4JTqayV7l3W7","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1744655856772,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":82,"user":{"displayName":"Siddarth SR Pillai","userId":"13382866031770543066"}}},"execution_count":35,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Minimal Preprocessing\n","def preprocess_text(text):\n","    if isinstance(text, str):  #

The  company , which  ended  the  first  quarter  with  sales  of  around  19 ,000  electric  vehicle  units , is  also  looking  to  have  a  separate  sales  infrastructure  for  its  electric  vehicle  portfolio  going  ahead . In  an  analyst  call , Tata  Motors  Passenger  Vehicles  Managing  Director  Shailesh  Chandra  noted  that  EV  adoption  is  now  growing  beyond  the  top  20  cities  in  the  country . \\\"With  the  bias  now  moving  to  other  parts  of  the  country ...that 's  a  good  sign  in  terms  of  how  the  EV  sales  will  grow  from  here ,\\\" he  said . With  the  launch  of  Tiago  EV  , there  has  been  a  shift  in  terms  of  micro  markets  now , Chandra  said . He  noted  that  more  than  49  per  cent  of  the  Tiago  EV  sales  were  now  coming  in  from  other  than  the  top  20  cities , he  added . Live  Events  \\\"And  therefore , we  have  taken  that  opportunity  to  really  start  expanding  our  network  in  those  smaller  cities  through  a  shop -in -shop  concept . As  we  are  expanding  in  these  cities , we  are  also  therefore  building  the  service  capability  from  an  infra  perspective  as  well  as  also  training  the  service  engineers  for  those  service  stations . So , that  is  also  an  ongoing  process ,\\\" Chandra  said . He  also  noted  that  in  order  to  cater  to  customers  all  across  the  country , the  company  may  look  at  separating  the  EV  showrooms  from  the  existing  sales  outlets . The  company  currently  has  a  shop -in -shop  concept  in  the  existing  dealers  to  sell  EV  products . \\\"And  going  forward , we  also  want  to  separate  ICE  as  well  as  the  EV  showrooms , as  and  when  we  see  the  volumes  in  certain  cities , which  go  to  a  certain  level  where  the  separate  channel  becomes  viable ,\\\" he  stated . Chandra  noted  that  the  company  expects  significant  margin  improvement  in  the  EV  business  on  account  of  enhanced  localisation  efforts  and  lower  cost  of  new  generation  aggregates . Besides , production -linked  incentive  (PLI ) scheme  for  Tiago  EV  and  reduction  in  battery  cell  prices  is  going  to  play  a  part  in  the  overall  growth  of  the  EV  segment , he  added . \\\"The  cell  prices  are  recovering  to  the  levels  where  it  was  in  H  1  and  the  impacts  should  start , being  felt  from  this  quarter  itself ...PLI  is  going  to  be  a  big  addition  to  the  margin , and  we  are  confident  that  we  are  adhering  to  all  the  requirements  for  the  eligibility  as  has  been  laid  down  by  the  ministry  (of  heavy  industries ),\\\" Chandra  said . He  noted  that  the  company  has  been  working  on  localisation  for  the  last  two  years  and  that  is  going  to  yield  significant  benefits  from  a  cost  reduction  perspective . \\\"There  are  new  generation  aggregates , which  are  also  going  to  come  in  this  financial  year , which  are  at  significantly  lower  costs . And  therefore , I 'm  very  confident  that  in  the  medium  term , within  this  year , I  would  say  with  all  the  combination  of  all  these  factors , the  outlook  for  EV  business  is  going  to  be  very  strong ,\\\" Chandra  said . The  company  aims  to  sell  around  1  lakh  EV  units  this  year .

according  to  a  top  company  executive  The  company  which  ended  the  first  quarter  with  sales  of  around  19 000  electric  vehicle  units  is  also  looking  to  have  a  separate  sales  infrastructure  for  its  electric  vehicle  portfolio  going  ahead  In  an  analyst  call  Tata  Motors  Passenger  Vehicles  Managing  Director  Shailesh  Chandra  noted  that  EV  adoption  is  now  growing  beyond  the  top  20  cities  in  the  country  With  the  bias  now  moving  to  other  parts  of  the  country that s  a  good  sign  in  terms  of  how  the  EV  sales  will  grow  from  here  he  said  With  the  launch  of  Tiago  EV   there  has  been  a  shift  in  terms  of  micro  markets  now  Chandra  said  He  noted  that  more  than  49  per  cent  of  the  Tiago  EV  sales  were  now  coming  in  from  other  than  the  top  20  cities  he  added  Live  Events  And  therefore  we  have  taken  that  opportunity  to  really  start  expanding  our  network  in  those  smaller  cities  through  a  shop in shop  concept  As  we  are  expanding  in  these  cities  we  are  also  therefore  building  the  service  capability  from  an  infra  perspective  as  well  as  also  training  the  service  engineers  for  those  service  stations  So  that  is  also  an  ongoing  process  Chandra  said  He  also  noted  that  in  order  to  cater  to  customers  all  across  the  country  the  company  may  look  at  separating  the  EV  showrooms  from  the  existing  sales  outlets  The  company  currently  has  a  shop in shop  concept  in  the  existing  dealers  to  sell  EV  products  And  going  forward  we  also  want  to  separate  ICE  as  well  as  the  EV  showrooms  as  and  when  we  see  the  volumes  in  certain  cities  which  go  to  a  certain  level  where  the  separate  channel  becomes  viable  he  stated  Chandra  noted  that  the  company  expects  significant  margin  improvement  in  the  EV  business  on  account  of  enhanced  localisation  efforts  and  lower  cost  of  new  generation  aggregates  Besides  production linked  incentive  PLI  scheme  for  Tiago  EV  and  reduction  in  battery  cell  prices  is  going  to  play  a  part  in  the  overall  growth  of  the  EV  segment  he  added  The  cell  prices  are  recovering  to  the  levels  where  it  was  in  H  1  and  the  impacts  should  start  being  felt  from  this  quarter  itself PLI  is  going  to  be  a  big  addition  to  the  margin  and  we  are  confident  that  we  are  adhering  to  all  the  requirements  for  the  eligibility  as  has  been  laid  down  by  the  ministry  of  heavy  industries  Chandra  said  He  noted  that  the  company  has  been  working  on  localisation  for  the  last  two  years  and  that  is  going  to  yield  significant  benefits  from  a  cost  reduction  perspective  There  are  new  generation  aggregates  which  are  also  going  to  come  in  this  financial  year  which  are  at  significantly  lower  costs  And  therefore  I m  very  confident  that  in  the  medium  term  within  this  year  I  would  say  with  all  the  combination  of  all  these  factors  the  outlook

The  company , which  ended  the  first  quarter  with  sales  of  around  19 ,000  electric  vehicle  units , is  also  looking  to  have  a  separate  sales  infrastructure  for  its  electric  vehicle  portfolio  going  ahead . In  an  analyst  call , Tata  Motors  Passenger  Vehicles  Managing  Director  Shailesh  Chandra  noted  that  EV  adoption  is  now  growing  beyond  the  top  20  cities  in  the  country . \\\"With  the  bias  now  moving  to  other  parts  of  the  country ...that 's  a  good  sign  in  terms  of  how  the  EV  sales  will  grow  from  here ,\\\" he  said . With  the  launch  of  Tiago  EV  , there  has  been  a  shift  in  terms  of  micro  markets  now , Chandra  said . He  noted  that  more  than  49  per  cent  of  the  Tiago  EV  sales  were  now  coming  in  from  other  than  the  top  20  cities , he  added . Live  Events  \\\"And  therefore , we  have  taken  that  opportunity  to  really  start  expanding  our  network  in  those  smaller  cities  through  a  shop -in -shop  concept . As  we  are  expanding  in  these  cities , we  are  also  therefore  building  the  service  capability  from  an  infra  perspective  as  well  as  also  training  the  service  engineers  for  those  service  stations . So , that  is  also  an  ongoing  process ,\\\" Chandra  said . He  also  noted  that  in  order  to  cater  to  customers  all  across  the  country , the  company  may  look  at  separating  the  EV  showrooms  from  the  existing  sales  outlets . The  company  currently  has  a  shop -in -shop  concept  in  the  existing  dealers  to  sell  EV  products . \\\"And  going  forward , we  also  want  to  separate  ICE  as  well  as  the  EV  showrooms , as  and  when  we  see  the  volumes  in  certain  cities , which  go  to  a  certain  level  where  the  separate  channel  becomes  viable ,\\\" he  stated . Chandra  noted  that  the  company  expects  significant  margin  improvement  in  the  EV  business  on  account  of  enhanced  localisation  efforts  and  lower  cost  of  new  generation  aggregates . Besides , production -linked  incentive  (PLI ) scheme  for  Tiago  EV  and  reduction  in  battery  cell  prices  is  going  to  play  a  part  in  the  overall  growth  of  the  EV  segment , he  added . \\\"The  cell  prices  are  recovering  to  the  levels  where  it  was  in  H  1  and  the  impacts  should  start , being  felt  from  this  quarter  itself ...PLI  is  going  to  be  a  big  addition  to  the  margin , and  we  are  confident  that  we  are  adhering  to  all  the  requirements  for  the  eligibility  as  has  been  laid  down  by  the  ministry  (of  heavy  industries ),\\\" Chandra  said . He  noted  that  the  company  has  been  working  on  localisation  for  the  last  two  years  and  that  is  going  to  yield  significant  benefits  from  a  cost  reduction  perspective . \\\"There  are  new  generation  aggregates , which  are  also  going  to  come  in  this  financial  year , which  are  at  significantly  lower  costs . And  therefore , I 'm  very  confident  that  in  the  medium  term , within  this  year , I  would  say  with  all  the  combination  of  all  these  factors , the  outlook  for  EV  business  is  going  to  be  very  strong ,\\\" Chandra  said .

Live  Events  \\\"And  therefore , we  have  taken  that  opportunity  to  really  start  expanding  our  network  in  those  smaller  cities  through  a  shop -in -shop  concept . As  we  are  expanding  in  these  cities , we  are  also  therefore  building  the  service  capability  from  an  infra  perspective  as  well  as  also  training  the  service  engineers  for  those  service  stations . So , that  is  also  an  ongoing  process ,\\\" Chandra  said . He  also  noted  that  in  order  to  cater  to  customers  all  across  the  country , the  company  may  look  at  separating  the  EV  showrooms  from  the  existing  sales  outlets . The  company  currently  has  a  shop -in -shop  concept  in  the  existing  dealers  to  sell  EV  products . \\\"And  going  forward , we  also  want  to  separate  ICE  as  well  as  the  EV  showrooms , as  and  when  we  see  the  volumes  in  certain  cities , which  go  to  a  certain  level  where  the  separate  channel  becomes  viable ,\\\" he  stated . Chandra  noted  that  the  company  expects  significant  margin  improvement  in  the  EV  business  on  account  of  enhanced  localisation  efforts  and  lower  cost  of  new  generation  aggregates . Besides , production -linked  incentive  (PLI ) scheme  for  Tiago  EV  and  reduction  in  battery  cell  prices  is  going  to  play  a  part  in  the  overall  growth  of  the  EV  segment , he  added . \\\"The  cell  prices  are  recovering  to  the  levels  where  it  was  in  H  1  and  the  impacts  should  start , being  felt  from  this  quarter  itself ...PLI  is  going  to  be  a  big  addition  to  the  margin , and  we  are  confident  that  we  are  adhering  to  all  the  requirements  for  the  eligibility  as  has  been  laid  down  by  the  ministry  (of  heavy  industries ),\\\" Chandra  said . He  noted  that  the  company  has  been  working  on  localisation  for  the  last  two  years  and  that  is  going  to  yield  significant  benefits  from  a  cost  reduction  perspective . \\\"There  are  new  generation  aggregates , which  are  also  going  to  come  in  this  financial  year , which  are  at  significantly  lower  costs . And  therefore , I 'm  very  confident  that  in  the  medium  term , within  this  year , I  would  say  with  all  the  combination  of  all  these  factors , the  outlook  for  EV  business  is  going  to  be  very  strong ,\\\" Chandra  said .
