# News Bias Detection Project

This project implements a Natural Language Processing (NLP) system for detecting and analyzing bias in news articles. It uses machine learning techniques to evaluate news content and identify potential biases in the reporting.

## 🌟 Features

- Automated bias detection in news articles
- Web-based interface for article analysis
- Support for multiple news sources
- Detailed bias analysis and scoring
- Frontend visualization of results
- RESTful API backend

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Web-based interface
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Machine Learning**: 
  - PyTorch
  - Transformers
  - Scikit-learn
  - NLTK
- **Data Processing**: 
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - BeautifulSoup4

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package manager)
- Virtual environment (recommended)

## 🚀 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/NLP-Project-News-Bias-Detection.git
cd NLP-Project-News-Bias-Detection
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
# On Windows
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On Unix or MacOS
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🏃‍♂️ Running the Project

### Backend
1. Navigate to the backend directory:
```bash
cd backend
```

2. Start the Flask server:
```bash
python app.py
```

### Frontend
1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
```bash
cd frontend
```

2. Follow the frontend-specific setup instructions in the frontend directory.
